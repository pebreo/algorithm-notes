Now before even trying to solve this equation, what I want to do is think a little bit about what this actually means. 7x equals 14, this is the exact same thing as saying 7 times x - let me write it this way -- 7 times x -- we'll do the x in orange again -- 7 times x is equal to 14. Now you might be able to do this in your head. You could literally go through the 7 times table. You say well 7 times 1 is equal to 7, so that won't work. 7 times 2 is equal to 14, so 2 works here. So you would immediately be able to solve it. You would immediately, just by trying different numbers out, say hey, that's going to be a 2. But what we're going to do in this video is to think about how to solve this systematically. Because what we're going to find is as these equations get more and more complicated, you're not going to be able to just think about it and do it in your head. So it's really important that one, you understand how to manipulate these equations, but even more important to understand what they actually represent. This literally just says 7 times x is equal to 14. In algebra we don't write the times there. When you write two numbers next to each other or a number next\"\n",
