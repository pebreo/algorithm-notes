    "# Monty Hall Simulation\n",
    "* Author: Paul Ebreo\n",
    "\n",
    "## How To Run\n",
    "Click the .ipynb file above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The Monty Hall puzzle is a puzzle that describes a situation where\n",
    "you are a contestant in a game show where you can win a car by choosing\n",
    "1 of 3 doors. Behind 2 of the doors is a goat and 1 is a car. \n",
    "In this situation, you have chosen Door # 1. Monty Hall, the host of the\n",
    "show, opens Door #3 and shows you that there's a goat behind that one. \n",
    "Is it better to switch to Door #2 (the door without the goat) or stick to your original decision of Door #1?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this program is to simulate this situation and compares\n",
    "the number of winnings of the two strategies a) stay in your original pick of Door #1\n",
    "or b) choose the other door that doesn't have a goat, in this case Door #2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "-For the stay strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup the board in `set_doors()` function by choosing a goat\n",
    "2. Set player selection by doing `selection = door1`\n",
    "3. Check if the player wins\n",
    "4. Add the result to `win_loss_result` list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-For the switch strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup the board as the stay strategy\n",
    "2. Set the player selection by doing `selection = door1`\n",
    "3. If the car is in door 2 or door 3, open the door with goat behind it and set `shown_goat = door-x`\n",
    "4. Based on this condition, the player selection will be the opposite of `door-x`\n",
    "5. Check if the player wins\n",
    "6. Add the result to `win_loss_result` list\n",
    "\n",
    "After running through 1000 iterations, we run `calculate_stay_strategy` and `calculate_switch_strategy` function and calculate\n",
    "the win ratio `wins / (wins+losses)`. And that's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "Based on the results, we see that about 2/3 of the time you win when \n",
    "you decide to switch to the Door #2. You win 1/3 of the time when you decide to \n",
    "stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Discussion\n",
    "When the board is set, the car will always have 1/3 chance to be in Door #1\n",
    "and 2/3 chance to be either in door 2 or door 3 (1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3).\n",
    "When door 3 is opened, the chance of door 3 becomes zero and door 2 becomes\n",
    "2/3. Because the two doors (2 and 3) combines must always be 2/3 (2/3 + 0 = 2/3).\n",
    "Another way to think of the always switch strategy is that when you've decided to\n",
    "always switch to either door 2 or 3 you'll always have 2/3 chance of winning and 1/3\n",
    "chance of losing (1/3 chance that the car is actually in door 1). And the fact\n",
    "that Monty shows the goat does not change the odds of 2/3 chance that the car will be in 2 or 3, rather it changes the fact that you know it won't be in door 3. It's important to note\n",
    "that the total odds don't change, for 2 and 3 just where those odds have shifted.\n",
    "\n",
    "<insert picture>\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining the mistaken intuition:\n",
    "Most people mistakenly think that total odds change when the door is opened. \n",
    "That is they think it becomes 50/50 or 1/2. The odds don't change they just shift\n",
    "in your favor to door 2 because the sum must always be 2/3 for door 2 OR door 3.\n",
